## Description

Natours is a project built to practice advanced CSS styling techniques, utilizing the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, Sass for CSS pre-processing, and [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) for local development.

This project showcases a fictional website for "Natours," a company offering exciting nature tour packages. It's designed to demonstrate modern CSS layouts, animations, and responsive design principles.

## Installation and Running Locally

To run Natours locally for development, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RenatoTMLima/advanced-css-natours.git
    cd advanced-css-natours
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or, if you prefer using other package managers like pnpm or Yarn, use their respective install commands.

3.  **Run the development server:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the `lite-server` concurrently with sass with watch flag, to transpile your scss code into css in real-time and open the Natours website in your browser. You can then start modifying the Sass files and see the changes live in your browser.

    If you are using a different package manager, use its corresponding command to run the `dev` script defined in `package.json`. For example, with pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    Or with Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

Now you're all set to explore and modify the Natours project locally!
